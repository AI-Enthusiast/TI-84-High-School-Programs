# TI-84-High-School-Programs
Programs most built to make math exams and homework easier. Programs build 2013-2016, many by me, many more not by me. Please use and distribute further. 

Download TI connect to transfer these to your TI-84 (some also work on the 83 but not all). You can edit these programs from TI Connect or on the calculator itself. Please distribute and enjoy!
